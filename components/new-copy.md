# case study card copy — hybrid structure (final)

this document contains the **final, full copy** for all case studies using the agreed **hybrid structure**.

each project uses:

* **card line 1** — images (visual impression)
* **card line 2** — what it was (unfuzzy: description, role, pride, tech)
* **card line 3** — project-specific framing (key decisions, constraints, highlights, etc.)

### card line 1 — images

*(product screenshots, collaboration views, system diagrams)*

### card line 2 — what it was

title card:**what it was**
card 1: a funded saas platform (€1.4m) built to help creators collaborate and express themselves online. 
card 2: rather than shipping a single fixed product, the platform was designed as a modular system capable of supporting multiple directions over time.

card 3: 
**my role**
co-founder & cto. owned system architecture, frontend and backend implementation, and production delivery end-to-end.

card 4:
**what i’m proud of**
building a real-time collaborative system that stayed coherent and adaptable while requirements changed.

card 5:
**technologies**
typescript, next.js, node.js, expo, firebase, google cloud, realtime sync, custom authorization, analytics

### card line 3 — key decisions


card 1:
title card: decision -- **modular architecture as the product**
in an early-stage startup, uncertainty is constant. instead of optimizing for a specific audience or workflow, the system was designed so the architecture itself carried the value. use cases, branding, and positioning could change without invalidating the core.

**decision two — collaboration and trust as first-class systems**
real-time collaboration and split payments were built into the foundation. creators could work together live and sell together without needing to meet, trust, or manually settle with each other, removing a major coordination barrier.

## circulose branding toolkit

### card line 1 — images

*(circulose branding, embedded tag examples, toolkit visuals)*

---

### card line 2 — what it was

**what it was**
an embeddable web system built for a publicly traded textile company to educate customers about a new material at the point of purchase, operating at global scale.

**my role**
lead engineer. responsible for system design, performance, analytics, and production delivery.

**what i’m proud of**
shipping a tiny, reliable system that could run millions of times per day without harming host sites or violating privacy.

**technologies**
cdn delivery, lightweight javascript, beacon api, custom ingestion pipelines, google cloud

---

### card line 3 — constraints & solutions

**constraint — embedding at massive scale**
the widget needed to load quickly, execute safely inside unknown environments, and fail gracefully. bundle size, execution cost, and reliability were treated as hard constraints.

**solution — privacy-preserving analytics**
traditional analytics tools weren’t viable. a lightweight, beacon-based approach provided meaningful insight without cookies, third-party scripts, or legal exposure.

## lilla auktionsstudion

### card line 1 — images

*(auction listings, admin views, bidding flows)*

---

### card line 2 — what it was

**what it was**
a production auction platform built for a small auction house running live and online auctions, including payments, seller onboarding, customer service tooling, and email marketing.

**my role**
consultant and lead developer. full responsibility for system design, implementation, and delivery.

**what i’m proud of**
delivering a complete operational platform under a very tight budget without over-engineering.

**technologies**
next.js, node.js, payment integrations, email systems, cloud hosting

---

### card line 3 — delivery highlights

**highlight — domain-first auction workflows**
the platform was modeled around how auctions actually operate: listings, bids, settlements, and sellers. generic ecommerce abstractions were deliberately avoided.

**highlight — production delivery under pressure**
delivered a full-featured system within strict constraints, prioritizing clarity and maintainability over unnecessary flexibility.

## arbitrage platform

### card line 1 — images

*(system flow diagrams, ingestion overview)*

---

### card line 2 — what it was

**what it was**
a high-throughput system for surfacing time-sensitive market opportunities by ingesting and analyzing large volumes of unstructured documents using ai.

**my role**
sole architect and engineer. designed and built the system end-to-end.

**what i’m proud of**
making ai inference predictable and economically viable at scale.

**technologies**
node.js, event-driven pipelines, llm apis, custom mcp orchestration, analytics

---

### card line 3 — cost & control

**cost — ai inference at scale**
processing hundreds of thousands of documents per day made naive ai usage unsustainable. inference cost was treated as infrastructure, not an afterthought.

**control — orchestration and observability**
a custom mcp-based control layer managed context reuse, batching, and execution flow, keeping the system predictable and adaptable.

## social graph

### card line 1 — images

*(network graphs, community visualizations)*

---

### card line 2 — what it was

**what it was**
a system built to understand markets by modeling relationships between users and communities rather than events or funnels.

**my role**
designed the data model and analytical approach.

**what i’m proud of**
turning abstract graph theory into practical market insight.

**technologies**
neo4j, graph algorithms, custom analysis pipelines

---

### card line 3 — insights

**insight — structure beats aggregates**
traditional analytics struggled to explain influence and discovery. modeling the market as a graph made underlying structure visible.

**insight — strategy from relationships**
community detection and centrality analysis revealed leverage points that directly informed positioning and go-to-market decisions.
