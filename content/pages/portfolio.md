## How I Work
I design systems around constraints: performance, cost, legal boundaries, and change. I own frontend and backend execution end‑to‑end and treat analytics and feedback loops as core system components. AI is integrated as infrastructure—observable, cost‑aware, and replaceable—rather than novelty.

**Backend & Infrastructure:** Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, Docker
**Data:** GraphQL, Neo4j / Cypher, SQL
