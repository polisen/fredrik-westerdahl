------------------

**Context**
The Social Graph project focused on understanding market structure by modeling relationships between users, communities, and influence patterns rather than relying on traditional demographic or funnel-based analytics.

**Problem**
Conventional analytics failed to explain how discovery, influence, and momentum actually propagated through the market. The challenge was identifying meaningful communities and key actors within a dense and evolving network.

**Key decisions**
I designed a graph-based data model treating relationships as first-class entities. On top of this, I applied community detection and centrality-based analysis to surface structural patterns and influential nodes relevant to product positioning and go-to-market decisions.

**Outcome**
The system provided clearer insight into audience structure and influence dynamics, demonstrating how graph-based architectures can inform strategic decisions beyond what traditional analytics allow.
