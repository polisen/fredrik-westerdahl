------------------

**Context**
An early-stage auction house startup required a production-ready web platform tailored to the operational needs of live and online auctions, delivered under a strict budget.

**Problem**
The system needed to support domain-specific workflows such as listings, bidding, and administration while remaining maintainable and cost-efficient within limited resources.

**Key decisions**
I implemented a lean, domain-aligned architecture with deliberate scoping to avoid unnecessary abstraction. Technical choices prioritized clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability while staying within budget constraints.

**Outcome**
The platform was delivered as a live production system within budget, demonstrating pragmatic engineering judgment and disciplined delivery under real-world constraints.
