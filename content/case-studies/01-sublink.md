------------------

**Context**
Sublink was a funded platform exploring modular content, identity, and social structures for creative work. I served as co-founder and CTO, with full ownership of technical architecture and production delivery.

**Problem**
The core challenge was designing a system flexible enough to support multiple potential product directions while remaining maintainable under early-stage startup constraints, including limited resources, legal considerations, and evolving requirements.

**Key decisions**
I designed a modular, domain-driven architecture with clear boundaries and integration points, allowing features to evolve independently without collapsing into a monolith. Analytics, permissions, and external integrations were treated as first-class architectural concerns. I also scoped and coordinated deliverables from external consultants to maintain long-term coherence as the system evolved.

**Outcome**
The platform was built and operated end-to-end under real constraints, demonstrating scalable system design, execution discipline, and technical ownership. The company was later dissolved, with the underlying IP retained.
