This article examines how graph-based data architectures can reveal market structure, influence patterns, and audience relationships that traditional analytics miss.

## The Problem with Traditional Analytics

Traditional demographic and funnel-based approaches fail to explain:

- How influence propagates through markets
- How discovery patterns emerge
- How communities form and interact

## Graph-Based Data Model

*(Placeholder for data model discussion)*

### Designing for Relationships

*(Placeholder for graph schema design)*

### Community Detection

*(Placeholder for community detection algorithms and implementation)*

### Centrality Analysis

*(Placeholder for centrality measures and their applications)*

## Strategic Applications

*(Placeholder for how insights drive product and GTM strategy)*

## Implementation Challenges

*(Placeholder for technical challenges and solutions)*

## Outcome

The system provided clearer insight into audience structure and influence, demonstrating the value of graph-based architectures for strategic decision-making.
